# Prism-IDE
What is Prism IDE? â€“ IDE is the front-end bot designer that provides cool drag & drop, point & click capabilities that will feed into the Prism bot library.

Prism is currently used to prototype chatbots internally. We are continuing to enhance Prism and developing a unit test suit. Please use it as you see fit. We'd love to have you participate in enhancing the asset and help develop unit test cases for Prism!

-	IDE works out of the local file system making version control very easy!
-	Provides a built-in code syntax highlighter and formatter for modifying JavaScript within the IDE
-	Enable your chatbot to talk slow to make it realistic or respond instantly depending on your need
-	Provides ability to manage (Enable/Disable) intents, commands and tasks
